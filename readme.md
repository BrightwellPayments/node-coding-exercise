# Portfolio
## Overview
Welcome to your first day at Port Folio, the sunny destination for all your investment plans.

You are taking over a feature that mostly works.  The previous author is not currently available, and you are being asked to get the feature over the line.

The Portfolio library allows customers to place a single `Order` to purchase a financial instrument for multiple `Companies` at one time.

## Prerequisites
1. Node v18+
2. docker + docker compose (docker desktop is easiest if not already setup)
3. An editor of your choice

## Setup
From a terminal
```
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it readyremit-interview-db-1 psql -U postgres
```

In psql
```
CREATE DATABASE portfolio;

\c portfolio;

CREATE TABLE companies (
    id              integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name            varchar(80)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id              integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    amount          decimal(18,2),
    fees            decimal(18,2)
);

CREATE TABLE line_items (
    id              integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    order_id        int,
    company_id      int,
    amount          decimal(18,2),

    CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_company FOREIGN KEY(company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);
```
